An Exercise on Deploying an RMI Application
March 2010

Part A
1. Create a folder called "RMILab" and extract all the files into this folder.
2. Create two subfolders called "ServerDir" and "ClientDir."
3. Move these three source files into the folder "ServerDir": 

      Product.java, ProductImpl.java, ProductServer.java.

4. Move these two source files into the folder "ClietnDir":
    
      Product.java, ProductClient.java.


Part B - The RMI Registry and the RMI Server
1. Open a DOS command prompt window (for running the RMI Registry).

   Go to the subfolder "ServerDir."

2. Run the command line: >rmiregistry 6666

3. Open another DOS command prompt window (for running the RMI server).

   Go to the subfolder "ServerDir."
   We should have three source files in the folder(ServerDir): 

      Product.java, ProductImpl.java, ProductServer.java

4. Run the command line: >javac ProudctImpl.java

5. Run the command line: >rmic  -v1.2 ProductImpl

6. Run the command lines:

   >javac ProductServer.java

   >java ProductServer


(Question: How many class files do you have in this folder?)

Part C - The RMI Client
1. Open a DOS command prompt window.
   Go to the folder "ClientDir."
   We should have two source files in the folder(ClientDir): 

      Product.java, ProductClient.java.

2. Copy "ProductImpl_Stub.class" from "ServerDir" into this folder(i.e. ClientDir).

3. Run the command line: >javac ProductClient.java

4. Run the command line: >java ProductClient


(Question: How many class files do you have in this folder?)

(Question: What is the purpose of having the rmic-generated stub class?)
(Question: For Java 1.5 and 1.6, is it necessary to have the rmic-generated stub class?)
